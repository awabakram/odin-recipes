        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten </li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a small bowl, mix together 1/3 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon; set aside.</li>
            <li>In large bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt and remaining 1 cup sugar. Combine egg, milk, and oil; add to flour mixture. Stir until just moistened.</li>
            <li>Pour half of the batter into pan. Sprinkle with half the reserved cinnamon/sugar mixture. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon/sugar mixture. Draw a knife through batter to marble.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap in foil and let sit overnight before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
